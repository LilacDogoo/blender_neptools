# blender_neptools
<p>A set of Blender tools to Import and Export to the Neptunia Games
<p><b>Use the ZIP file</b> to quickly install to Blender.
  <br>No need to unzip it.
  <br>Navigate to 'Edit > Preferences > Add-ons'. Use the install button here.

<p>Currently I have importing models working for:
<ul>
<li>Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth1
<li>Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth2
<li>Hyperdimension Neptunia Re;Birth3
<li>Megadimension Neptunia VII
</ul>

<p>Some face textures will fail. I assume it has to do with the way the faces are animated.

<p>I am quite familiar with Java but I am very new to Python.
<p>Blender add-ons are written in Python so I had to learn.
